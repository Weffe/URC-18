rover_gui
=============

The rover_gui package contains nearly all of the guis for the rover, excluding the map (see see ``rover_jsmap``)

The package contains one special directory, the ``rqt`` directory.

This directory contains each of the predefined rqt perspectives for the rover. You can load them by going into rqt and importing the perspective files.

See the usage docs for information on what each of them does.
